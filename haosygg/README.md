## Yggdrasil for HomeAssistant

Yggdrasil - decentralized mesh network. It doesn't have central control points, devices automaticaly organize the optimal path through connected directly nodes. In case there is no direct connection between parts of network, peering through traditional internet can be configured. More info here https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/about.html IPs in Yggdrasil are static and don't change, nodes automatically switch to direct data transmission when they find each other locally, so you can access your HomeAssistant by the same IP while connecting LAN only or through Web.
