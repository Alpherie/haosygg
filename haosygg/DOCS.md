## Yggdrasil

#### How to setup

Yggdrasil network requires a config file to work. It contains private key that defines your IP, and additional settings like peers for connecting through traditional Web. You need to generate and edit your config file before using Yggdrasil. More about config here https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/configuration.html 

Config file for plugin should be named `yggdrasil.conf` file and located in your `addon_config/*_haosygg` folder on HomeAssistant device. You can copy it there with ssh or samba.
